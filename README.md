### Not So Basic Calculator

# second Javascript assignment

## Explorer Mode

* Create a NEW html and javascript calculator.
  * This one should have buttons for numbers 0-9
  * buttons for each of the 4 basic math operators (+, -, /, \*)
  * a button with the equals sign
  * an output area for displaying the result

For explorer mode, you only need to perform math on two single digit integers. You are only expected to display the final result. Make sure that the correct math is being done!

## Notes
Although you may discover it and it may be tempting, you may not use eval() for this project!
FUNCTION BEFORE STYLES! A styled but non-functional calculator is not ok! Finish functionality before styling.

## Reflection

Previous to this assignment, my javascript knowledge and practice was very minimal. While I am understanding the basic logic of javascript, it is still difficult to pull all the pieces together at times. It's easy to get stuck in the "trees for the forest". 

The assignment took longer, as I had to start over 3 times before coming to a javascript flow that work. I would like to have had more time to work towards the next levels, Adventure and Epic mode.

## Adventurer Mode

Add the following features:

Make the numbers and calculations appear on the calculator display.
A decimal point (Hint: you can add a decimal point to a String, then change the String into a Number)
A button to flip between positive and negative
A "clear" that clears the output area and the memory of the math being performed

## Epic Mode

Add the following functions to your calculator:

allow more than on operator to be entered in a single go, and respect order of operations when calculating
